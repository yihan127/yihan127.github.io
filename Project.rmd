Exploratory Data Analysis
=====================================

Inputs {.sidebar}
-------------------------------------

 - The top left histogram tells us the overall distribution of players' age. We could see that their age is range from 18 to 33, and twenty-five-year-old football player has the largest number.
 
 - The top right right histograms reveals the age distribution of players of the top 10 countries. Nearly all of them are positive skew distribution. Most of them are under 25. 
 
 - The bottom left line graph indicates the relationship between players' age and value. From 15 to 26, the relationship is proportional which means that the more older player are, the higher value. However, after 30-year-old, the relationship is inversely proportional. As a result, 25 to 30 is the golden age for football players.
 
 - The bottom right histogram shows the salary condition in top 10 paid teams. The top two are Real Madrid CF and FC Barcelona.
