Multiple types of visulizations would be achieved:

 1. Explanatory Data Analysis
 
    - 
   
 2. Geographical Visualization
 
 3. Network Visualization
 
 4. Time series
 
 5. Text Visualization 

Through the aboved visulization analysis, many possible explorations are completedï¼š

For example, the co-related between age and potential of players; is there a pattern in the results of competition over the years; which group pays the most attention to this prestigious football tournament. Further, combining the information of players and historical results, we could infer if there is particular strength could detemine the team's victory.
